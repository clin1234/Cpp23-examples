# C++23 and C++20 Examples

[![ci](https://github.com/scivision/Cpp23-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scivision/Cpp23-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

Examples of using CMake with
[C++26](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/26),
C++23, and C++20 standard syntax.
This is useful for testing of compilers and build systems--already several bugs have been so detected.

We typically use
[feature testing macros](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test)
to detect a feature, but some features require a small compile and link test.
