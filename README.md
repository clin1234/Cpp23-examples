Examples of using CMake with C++23 and C++20 standard syntax, for testing of compilers and build systems.

## C++20 modules

C++20 modules require recent C++ compilers such as:

* Visual Studio &ge; [16.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/standard-c20-modules-support-with-msvc-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-8/)
* GCC or Clang (need added options at this time)

CMake &ge; 3.26 is strongly recommended for support of C++20 modules.

A fully working

shows more advanced use of C++20 modules.
