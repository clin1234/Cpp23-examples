# C++23 and C++20 Examples

[![ci](https://github.com/scivision/Cpp23-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/scivision/Cpp23-examples/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

Examples of C++23 and C++20 syntax, for testing of compilers and build systems.
This repo focuses on CMake.
xmake and Meson also have some examples.

## C++20 modules

C++20 modules require recent C++ compilers such as:

* Visual Studio &ge; [16.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/standard-c20-modules-support-with-msvc-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-8/)

CMake &ge; 3.25 continue to upgrade support for C++20 modules.
Visual Studio works with C++ modules.
Additional compiler support (GCC, Clang) is emerging from the compiler vendors.

A fully working

shows more advanced use of C++20 modules.
